# Logical Truth Layer (LTL)

Logical Truth Layer is a **neutral, non-custodial, non-operational**
transaction observability and reconciliation technology
for multi-ledger financial systems.

This system does NOT move money.
It does NOT custody funds.
It does NOT replace existing bank systems.

It provides a deterministic truth abstraction
above independent ledgers to expose:
- what is known
- what is unknown
- where ambiguity exists

Ambiguity is treated as risk — never hidden, never guessed.

## Why This Exists

Cross-border and interbank payments fail silently.
Each institution sees only its own ledger.
No party can safely claim end-to-end truth.

Logical Truth Layer answers one question only:

> “What do we objectively know about this transaction — and what do we not?”

## What This Is NOT

- Not a payment system
- Not a settlement layer
- Not a switch
- Not a blockchain
- Not a crypto system

---

## Who Uses This

- Banks
- Payment switches
- Clearing institutions
- Regulators (observer role only)
- Auditors

---

## Design Principles

- Non-custodial
- Bank-native
- Regulator-friendly
- Append-only
- Ambiguity-first
- Neutral by design

- `spec/` — normative specifications
- `governance/` — neutrality & versioning rules
- `reference/` — non-normative explanations
