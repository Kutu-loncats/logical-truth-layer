# Logical Truth Layer (LTL)

Logical Truth Layer is a neutral, non-custodial, non-operational
transaction observability and reconciliation technology
for multi-ledger financial systems.

This system does NOT move money.
It does NOT custody funds.
It does NOT replace existing bank systems.

It provides a deterministic truth abstraction
above independent ledgers to expose:
- what is known
- what is unknown
- where ambiguity exists
